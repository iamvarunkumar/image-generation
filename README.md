4. Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command based on your operating system:

    ```<virtual_env_name>\Scripts\activate```

# Step 2: Setting up Git and GitHub
1. Install Git on your system by downloading it from the official website and following the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. Go to https://github.com/ and sign up for an account.
# Step 3: Cloning the Repository
1. Go to the GitHub repository where you want to work on the project.
2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
5. Run the following command to clone the repository

    ```git clone <repository_url>```

    Replace <repository_url> with the URL you copied in step 2.

# Step 4: Creating a New Branch
1. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
2. Run the following command to create a new branch

    ```git branch <branch_name>```

    Replace <branch_name> with the name you want to give to your branch.

3. Switch to the newly created branch by running the following command.

    ```git checkout <branch_name>```

# Step 5: Making Changes and Committing
1. Open the project files in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code.
2. Make the necessary changes to the code.
3. Save the changes.
4. Go back to your terminal or command prompt.
5. Run the following command to check the status of your changes:

    ```git status```

    This will show you the files that have been modified.
